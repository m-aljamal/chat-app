                firebase login
                Initiate your project
                Run this command from your app’s root directory:


                firebase init
                Specify your site in firebase.json
                Add your site name to the firebase.json configuration file. After you get set up, see the best practices for multi-site deployment.


                {
                "hosting": {
                    "site": "chat-for-money",
                    "public": "public",
                    ...
                }
                }
                When you’re ready, deploy your web app
                Put your static files (e.g., HTML, CSS, JS) in your app’s deploy directory (the default is “public”). Then, run this command from your app’s root directory:


                firebase deploy --only hosting:chat-for-money
                After deploying, view your app at chat-for-money.web.app
